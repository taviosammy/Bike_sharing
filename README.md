# Bike_sharing
Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.  
The goal of this analysis is to examine the trends of the New York citibike ridership.  We aim to detect trends and patterns that may help us
determine if a similar bike sharing operation is feasible in Des Moine, Iowa.

Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

The first two charts illustrates the most popular amount of time to spend riding is about 5 -6 hours.
The second chart breaks it down by gender. This show which sex rides more frequently and would expose if there were
any differences in prefered length of rides. It would seem both sexes ride similar lengths at a time.

The above heat map quickly gives an idea of the popular times of the day for rides.  A spike is noticable in the mornings
and evenings which is reasonably expected as peak commuting hours.  It also shows the weekends having higher ridership than the weekdays.

This heat map is similar the one above but gives an extra breakdown comparing the two sexes.

This Chart gives us an idea of the usage by subscribers vs short-term users.

These maps pinpoint the popular stations rides are started and ended.  These maps are almost identical which wouild mean most riders return to the original
station the grabbed a bike.


Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

From the data, we have gotten quick bites of ideas that will potentially guide the decision making when setting up a rideshare operation.
Male customers are the clear majority.  Most riders are also subscribers so it would do well keep repeat riders happy rather than market to new customers.
Based on the peak riding hours it is clear a significant share of rides are used for commuting in the morning and evenings.  Rides during the middle of the day are low 
during the week but pick up significantly on the weekdays.  Most start points appear to be the same endpoints which would helps the idea that commuters are the bulk
of the ridership.  

Other vizualizations that may aid in decisions are a map that highlights popular routes between start and endpoints, to identify prefered scenary or traffic avoidance by the rider.
Also a chart that looked into if there are certain locations that are prefered by men or women could give insight in choosing future parking sites.
